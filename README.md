# BGCT-AlertSystem

Simple system built on PHP to help the Boys and Girls Club of Tustin to call kids(members) from various rooms within their building. I didn't have the option to create a full on Apache and MySQL server so as a work around, i'm dropping alerts as text files in folder instead of updating a database.
